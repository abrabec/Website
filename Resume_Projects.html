    <h1>Projects and Hobbies</h1>

    <h2>Junior Design "Project Sisyphus"</h2>
    <p>Our design ream planned, designed and proposed a solution to
      “Project Sisyphus”.  Project Sisyphus involved using a set amount of potential energy
      to repeat task a mundane as many times as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Solidworks Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
        Over the past few years, I have spent time learning the essential tools
        in solidworks.  If you want to see some of the stuff I have made, here is
        a link:<br> <a href="http://bit.ly/SW_P">Solidworks Portfolio</a>
    </p>

    <h2>3D Printing</h2>
    <p>
        To pair with the solidworks, I have printed a few of my designs.
        This has helped me gain alot of insight into how to design parts for
        manufacturing.

    <h2>Software Exploration</h2>
    <p>
        Something that I quickly learned during my internship at Northrop
        was how integral software was to almost everything.  Even as a mechanical
        engineer, sofware is still imporant.  During that internship and currently,
        I have been going through and learning the basics of the general types of software
        development such as Matlab/Python scripting, C based languages and HTML and CSS as
        shown (hopefully well) by this website!
